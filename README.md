# Ultimate Rust 2: Intermediate Concepts

This is the companion repository that **I had followed** for the `Ultimate Rust 2: Intermediate Concepts` (the followup to the popular [Ultimate Rust Crash Course]).  _UR2IC_ will be published independently online in the second half of 2021 and is also presented live as part of some O'Reilly virtual events such as  [Rust in 3 Weeks], or taught in-person for corporate training.  You will get the most out of this training experience by doing the [exercises] in this repository and watching (or attending) the instructor-led training.

In other words, this repository is for you hands-on-learners!

I use macOS, and that is what I developed this course on.  Everything _ought_ to work similarly on major Linux distributions and Windows. Please [contact me](mailto:nathan@agileperception.com) ASAP if you have trouble with anything on this page.

## Install Rust & Prepare Your Development Environment

Rust is required for this course!  The latest stable version is always recommended. See [the repository for the previous course] for instructions on how to install Rust, prepare your development environment, and helpful resources.

## Examples

- This course goes over a lot of code in lecture format. Much of the code from the lectures can be found in the [`example/`] directory in this repository.
- I had follow all the lesson with each [git branch](https://github.com/SarathLUN/ultimate_rust2/branches/yours).

## Exercises

Please clone this repository! These exercises are designed as Rust projects for you to edit on your own computer.

The exercises are separate Rust projects inside the `exercises/` subdirectory.  For each exercise, you should:
- Open the corresponding`exercise/EXERCISE_NAME` directory in your IDE/Editor
- Navigate to the same directory with your Terminal application (so you can run `cargo run`, etc.)
- Open up the `src/main.rs` file.
- Follow the numbered exercise instructions in the code comments.
- I had completed all the exercises with each [git branch](https://github.com/SarathLUN/ultimate_rust2/branches/all?query=exercise).
